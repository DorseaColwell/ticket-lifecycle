<p>
Ticket Creation (Intake)

A user submits a new ticket through the client portal or via email.
The system assigns a unique ticket ID and sets the status to "New."
Assignment and Initial Response

An agent reviews the new ticket and assigns it to the appropriate department or individual.
The ticket status changes to "Open."
An acknowledgment is sent to the user, confirming receipt.

<p>
Investigation and Resolution

The assigned agent investigates the issue, communicates with the user for additional information if necessary, and works towards resolving the problem.
Throughout this process, the ticket status remains "Open," and internal notes or responses are documented.

Resolution and Closure

Once the issue is resolved, the agent updates the ticket with the resolution details.
The ticket status is changed to "Resolved," and a notification is sent to the user with the resolution information.
After a predefined period or upon user acknowledgment, the ticket is automatically or manually marked as "Closed."
